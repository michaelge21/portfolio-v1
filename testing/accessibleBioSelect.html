                    michael is a free-lance web developer driven to define and make a positive impact. He tries his hardest to tolerate spicy food.                
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    michael is a multi-disciplinary developer, drawing upon backgrounds in cognitive and educational psych, 
                    creative writing, and teaching. 
                    A proud generalist, he tries his hardest to make something better everyday.

                <p class="bio">
                    michael enjoys examining abstractions like “impact,” “rhetoric,” and “leadership,” 
                    spending late nights mulling over how to operationalize and apply them to his work. 
                    He built a pan-Asian mental health conference as an undergrad, and tries his hardest to
                    continue speaking and advocating for his communities.

                <p class="bio">
                    michael is a second-gen Chinese American raised in Wisconsin. 
                    The last five years have been a journey exploring being Asian in the Midwest, 
                    and he has firmly settled on the answer of: “I go out for Culver's, but I go home 
                    for 红烧肉 (red braised pork).” He leads teams knowing that friends achieve more than coworkers. 
                    Michael will never stop supporting Liverpool FC unless someone confronts him confrontationally.  
                    When his joints do not ache, he is trying his hardest to teach breaking and house in Madison.
