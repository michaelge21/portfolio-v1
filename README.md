# portfolio-v1

Nice to meet you! This site is my first attempt at a portfolio/personal site. It began as a playground for basic HTML, CSS, and JS, evolving over the course of my learning into the mini-site that you see now.

The page is built by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and I used Prettier + Parcel in terms of tooling. 

I intend to rebuild this site using Vue soon to gain more experience with JS frameworks!
